All Shatter Fantasy packages use a combination of licenses depending on what 
you plan to do with it. If you don't fall under any of the following scenarios outlined below 
you are under 'GPLv3 license' which allows for a lot of freedom.

[GPLv3 license Guide](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html)

Shatter Fantasy below is shortened to SF to lower word count.

None of them require paying all packages are free to use commercially.
Anything you make with the tools is yours and no one can fight against it.

## Scenario One - Adding new set of tools on top of them and releasing them while including the SF package in your tool.
This goes for the following cases:
- Unity asset store sells
- Sharing from a public GitHub repo.
- Selling the tool on your own website.

The license is: 'GPLv3 license'.

If you are adding new tools on top of the SF package as long as you don't say you made 
the base SF packages you are using, do whatever you want. Credits or donations are appreciated though.
This goes for free and paid tools.

Reason to not say the base SF package is your own is due to the people who helped make the tool.
We want to make sure anyone who gave advice or helped with the tools are not removed from the praise of their hard work.
See credits document for all information about them. 


## Scenario Two - Just copying a couple scripts and not taking the base package,
don't worry about it. 'Shatter Fantasy' studio has no problems letting people copy and paste 
code without giving credits. We do ask the cut off point of just a couple scripts be like 15 or so though.
Credit and thank you again is appreciated and for a couple scripts don't worry about any required license.

## Scenario Three - Tools used in making a game that is being published.
Game can be free or paid for, go for it. All I ask for is credits like a small thank you
somewhere in game that players can see mentioning that the Shatter Fantasy tools/packages were used.

# Donations help make new features.
If anyone wants to help I do accept donations. Donations go toward helping ad new features and maintining the packages.
